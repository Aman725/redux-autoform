Change log
===

`React-metaform` uses **SemVer 2.0**. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

 - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
 - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
 - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
 
However, before the 1.0.0 release, I'm *not changing* the major version, even if the change breaks compatibility.
